## What is Dockware WEB?

Dockware WEB is designed to provide developers with an optimal environment that includes multiple
"latest" PHP and Node.js versions, Xdebug, and essential tools.
Its goal is to streamline development workflows with an up-to-date and clean setup.

Just run the container, and develop and Node, PHP or other web applications
without the hazzle of setting up your local environment.

> For all these cool features like Xdebug, Filebeat, Supervisor and more, please check out the Docs at www.dockware.io

## Quick Start

```bash 
docker run -p 80:80 dockware/web:latest
```

That's it, connect into the container and start coding.

If you need a more complex setup, you can use a `docker-compose.yml` file.
This sample even mounts your local **src** folder to the Apache DocRoot and also switches
to PHP 8.4 and Node 20.

```yaml
  website:
    image: dockware/web:latest
    volumes:
      - "./src:/var/www/html"
    environment:
      - PHP_VERSION=8.4
      - NODE_VERSION=20
```
